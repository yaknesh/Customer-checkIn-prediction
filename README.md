# Customer-checkIn-prediction


Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution)

Ans: Not like particularly single problem. Before as a designer i had to work new softwares and new kind of creatives. Eventhough i didnt completely know about the problem or software i can able to quickly learn and obtain solution in short duration.

Explain back propagation and tell us how you handle a dataset if 4 out of 30 parameters have null values more than 40 percentage?

Ans: Back-Propagation is a fine tuning based on the errors or loss from pevious epoch.
In 30 parameters 4 has more null value in that case first i drop those parameters and make a model. After that filling the null values with respect to
the kind of dataset.
